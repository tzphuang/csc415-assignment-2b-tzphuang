*
* Description: program has an array of file control blocks for individual files
* 	to be stored and referenced and can have up to 20 individual files opened at once.
*	Program has b_open which will find a free fcb within the fcbArray and fill that with
*	the passed in parameters. b_read will dump "count" number of bytes if we have enough
*	avaliable from 512 chunk buffer, if we dont have enough bytes to fill user's buffer
*	we dump what we have first, refill our buffer, and then fill the user's buffer with
*	how many the user's buffer is still needed. b_close frees a buffer from a relevant
*	file descriptor and sets its file information to null so the fcbArray knows it 
*	can use it again
